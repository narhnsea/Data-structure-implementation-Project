The code goal `a1_partd.py` is to find a path from the starting cell `(from_cell)` to the destination cell `(to_cell)` within the given maze.

The find_path function takes three arguments: 
- `maze`, which is an instance of the Maze class representing the maze structure,
 - `from_cell`, the ID of the starting cell, and
 - `to_cell`, the ID of the destination cell.

 The function begins by checking if the starting cell is the same as the destination cell. If they are the same, it immediately returns a list containing only the starting cell ID, representing the path from the starting cell to itself. 

    def find_path(maze, from_cell, to_cell):

       if from_cell == to_cell:

            return [from_cell]

Next, the starting cell is marked using the mark_cell method of the maze object. This is done to keep track of which cells have already been visited during the path-finding process.

    def mark(neighbour):
        if maze.get_is_marked(neighbour) == False:
            return True


The function then defines two nested helper functions: `mark` and `equal_cell`. The mark function takes a neighboring cell ID (neighbour) as input and checks if that cell is not marked (i.e., it has not been visited before). It returns True if the cell is unmarked, which is used to shorten the subsequent if statements.
   
The `equal_cell` function takes a neighboring cell ID (neighbour) as input and checks if it is equal to the destination cell ID (to_cell). If they are equal, it immediately returns a list containing both the starting cell and the destination cell IDs, representing the path from the starting cell to the destination cell.

The algorithm then recursively explores the neighboring cells in a clockwise manner starting from the right cell. For each neighboring cell that is unmarked, it checks if the cell is equal to the destination cell using the equal_cell function. If they are equal, it recursively calls the find_path function with the neighboring cell as the new starting cell. If a valid path is found (i.e., the recursive call returns a non-empty path), it prepends the starting cell ID to the path and returns it.

The same process is repeated for the left, up, and down neighboring cells, respectively. If no valid path is found after checking all the neighboring cells, an empty list is returned to indicate that there is no path from the starting cell to the destination cell in the given maze.

The code assumes the maze object has methods such as `get_right`, `get_left`, `get_up`, and `get_down`, which return the cell ID of the neighboring cell in the respective direction (-1 if there is no neighbor in that direction), as well as a get_is_marked method to check if a cell has been marked.

P.s-- to avoid copying the entire code into the reflection, only explanation with some codes are included here but the rest of the code can be foung in a1_partd.py

The code goal `a1_partb.py` is to implements sets.

The SetList class represents a collection of sets, and each set is implemented as a linked list of nodes.

Each node in the list contains a refrence to the data it holds, the set it belongs to and finally the links to it's preceding and next node

The node class contains of several methods which returns us data of the node, next node, previous node and itself.

Similarly, SetList class too contains of several methods. Lets look at those methods one by one.

`get_front()` simply returns the head/first node of the list.

`get_back()` much similar to the previous method retruns the tail/last node of the list.

`make_set()` creates a new set with a single node cotaining the data. It first checks if the set already exists. If it does it simply returns None, otherwise it creates a 
new node and set it as the head and tail.

`find_data()` searches for a node with the given data in the list. It loops throught the list starting from the head and returns the node if found.Else, it reurns None.

`representative()` return the data of the representaitve node. If the list is empty it returns None.

`union_set()` joins the set list with another set list`(other_set)`. It sets the set list of each node in 'other_list' to the current set list('self). It then appends the nodes of 'other_set; to the current set list by updatng the `next-node` and 'tail' refrences of the class. Finally, it sets the tail and head of the 'other_list' to None indicating that it is now disconnected from the set list. It returns the number of the nodes in the 'other_list'.

`len()` returns the number of nodes present in the list. It iterates over the list and increments a counter by 1 everytime a node is found.

The code goal `a1_partc.py` is to optimize the operations and performance of the Disjoint Set data structure.
Parent and size are two dictionaries that the DisjointSet class makes use of. Each element in the sets has a parent element maintained by the parent dictionary, and each set's size is tracked by the size dictionary.

In order to construct a new set with the specified element, the make_set(element) method adds the element to the parent dictionary with itself as the parent. If the element is successfully created, it returns True; if it already exists in the disjoint set, it returns False.


Get the size of the set containing the given element using the get_set_size(element) method. The element's existence in the parent dictionary is verified, and the size from the size dictionary is returned. It returns 0 in the absence of the element.


The root of the set that includes the specified element is identified by the find_set(element) method, which then returns it. It directly updates the parent of each explored element to the root in order to optimise subsequent search operations. If the element is absent from the disjoint set, None is returned.

The procedure union_set(element1, element2) combines the sets that contain both elements. First, it determines if both elements are present in the disjoint set and if they are members of distinct sets. By comparing the sizes of the sets, it conducts a weighted union if these requirements are satisfied. The root of the larger set is changed to be the parent of the smaller set, and the larger set's size is increased as a result. 

The n_sets counter's value is obtained by the get_num_sets() method, which then returns the total number of sets in the disjoint set.

The __len__() method returns the value of the n_elements counter in addition to the number of elements in the disjoint set.
